## 🎯 What We're NOT Doing (Removed)

### Removed: Unnecessary Complexity
- ❌ Prisma (Supabase is sufficient)
- ❌ NextAuth.js (Supabase Auth is better)
- ❌ Supabase Auth UI (Custom components are better)
- ❌ Complex testing setup (Focus on core features first)
- ❌ Advanced monitoring (Basic error tracking is enough)
- ❌ Social login providers (Email/password is sufficient)
- ❌ Complex caching (Supabase handles this)

### Removed: Over-Engineering
- ❌ Multiple state management stores (Start simple)
- ❌ Complex admin dashboard (Basic moderation is enough)
- ❌ Advanced analytics (Basic tracking is sufficient)
- ❌ Performance optimization (Focus on functionality first)

## 🚀 Quick Wins (Next 2 hours)

1. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Fix import issues in onboarding screens
2. [ ] Add loading states to existing components
3. [ ] Create basic error handling for API calls
4. [ ] Connect dashboard to real data
5. [ ] Test the existing API routes

## 📝 Development Principles

- **Keep it simple** - Don't over-engineer
- **Use existing components** - Don't rebuild what we have
- **Focus on core features** - Recovery, streaks, community
- **Supabase-first** - Use Supabase features instead of external tools
- **Mobile-first** - Ensure everything works on mobile
